# ARBirdHunter
We have all played TV Video games when we were little. Those were one of the best days of our lives. Wanting to bring back old memories but in a brand-new way we are developing “AR Bird Hunter” inspired by the classic “Duck hunt”. This is a fun sports  game(We do not support killing of animals and birds). The basic idea is that this application will ask for camera permissions in your device, then after a quick scan of the environment, detecting planes and walls, it will spawn birds randomly in the environment around you. You can only see and interact with them through your device. These are some angry birds and you being in first person view, these birds will be coming towards you and you would have to shoot them before they reach you. There will be a Health bar and a gun showing the remaining health and bullets and a number of different functionalities. The number of Birds and hence the difficulty will keep increasing with time.
